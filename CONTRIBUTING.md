# Issue Guidelines
Issues with RSM should be clear, consise, replicatable, and well-written.
# Branch Merges
All branch merges will be personally reviewed
# Fork Guidelines
RSM is free to fork for anyone, though, I would reccomend only changing reader.txt and simply writing your own .mailbox reader, as index.html is meant just for the front page of the website, and bookmarklet.js is just a short way to access reader.js from about:blank
